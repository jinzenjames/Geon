An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown. Routing is an essential concept in Single Page Applications (SPA). When our application is divided into separated logical sections, and all of them are under their own URL, users can easily share links among each other. A router solves the issue of having to make requests to the server each time users request new content by having all the website's content loaded on initial load. It then dynamically displays the correct content onto the page based on the URL's pathname. To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router This is a simple webpage of a company which implemented using spa.The page contains 4 components home,about,contact,services that navigate through each component.In each page we use some bootstrap class to make the pages more responsive and more appealing.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
